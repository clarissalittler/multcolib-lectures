* Presentation
** Welcome!                                                           :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(org-show-animate '("Welcome to the library!"))
#+END_SRC
** HTML
   The backbone of every web page, the actual content that's to be displayed

   Made up of /matching tags/

   #+BEGIN_SRC html :exports code
     <p>The p tags help make this a paragraph</p>

     <button>This is the text on a button</button>

     <ol>
       <li>Here's the pieces of a list</li>
       <li>One by one, nested li tags inside an ol</li>
     </ol>

     <p>The important thing here isn't
       where I put the
       line
       breaks
       but rather
       that the
       tags match</p>
   #+END_SRC
** CSS                                                                :slide:
   The code that describes how the content should /look/
   
   CSS has a very rigid structure
   #+BEGIN_SRC css :exports code
     selector {
         property-name: property-value;
         property-name: property-value;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   The kinds of selectors we'll be using are the three basic ones

   just using the /tag name/ selects every element with that tag
   #+BEGIN_SRC css :exports code
     p {
         color: red;
         width: 200px;
     }
   #+END_SRC
   using a . means you want every element with that /class/ name
   #+BEGIN_SRC css :exports code
     .thesis {
         font-weight: bold;
         font-style: italic;
     }
   #+END_SRC
   using a # means you want only the element with that /id/ to be affected
   #+BEGIN_SRC css :exports code
     #sidebar {
         width: 300px;
         background-color: green;
     }
   #+END_SRC
   
** JavaScript                                                         :slide:
   An actual programming language

   Makes web pages interactive!
** Neocities                                                          :slide:
   You should have a neocities tab open on your browser
   (if you're not in the classroom you can make an account for yourself instead of using my teaching accounts)
   It should look like

** Review: Making a small page                                        :slide:
   This is for review to remind your fingers of how things work!

   Open a new file in neocities and type the following. See if it loads and ask about /anything/ confusing.

   #+BEGIN_SRC html :exports code :tangle firstExample.html
     <html>
       <head>
         <style>
   	p {
             width: 300px;
             font-size: 30px;
             color: blue;
   	}

   	li {
             color: red;
   	}
         </style>
       </head>
       <body>
         <p>You should fill in the text here with whatever you want.</p>
         <ol>
   	<li>And put some other text here</li>
   	<li>And also here</li>
         </ol>
         <a href="http://multcolib.org">Here's a link!</a>
       </body>
     </html>

** Making pages interactive
   JavaScript makes pages interactive. The pineal gland between JavaScript interpreter and browser is the /Document Object Model/ usually just abbrevited to DOM. 
** What's JavaScript?
   JavaScript is a full programming language that is the agreed upon standard for browsers to use
** What's the DOM?
   The DOM is a way of presenting the webpage you're looking at as data for the JavaScript code to manipulate
** What to learn?
   If you want to learn more about HTML then try going to
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
   and looking through their examples and explanations, try making something out of what you've learned

   If you feel comfortable with the HTML you know but want to learn more about CSS then try going to
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS
   and reading through their tutorials

   Finally, if you're ready to jump into JavaScript 
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript
   and specifically to learn more about the DOM
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents

   Try working on your own and if working on your own /doesn't work/ then ask me and I'll help guide you through!
