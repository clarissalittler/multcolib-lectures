* Why Learn Programming?
** What You'll Learn Here
   + What programming *is* \pause
   + The basics of Javascript \pause
   + What to learn next
** Why Learn Programming?
   + To get a job \pause
   + To make your own websites \pause
   + To write your own mobile apps \pause
   + Because it's fun!
** This Course
   + Three weeks \pause
   + Two hours each \pause
   + Lecture and small exercises
** Programming The Web
   + Browsers \pause
   + Servers \pause
   + Modern interactive webpages
** Write Scripts
   + Browser extensions \pause
   + Chrome plugins \pause
   + Make websites what you want to be \pause
   + Millenials => Lizard People
** Javascript is Ubiquitous
   + One of the most common languages \pause
   + Powers all interactive websites
** Javascript is Simple(ish)
   + The core of Javascript is simple \pause
   + Complicated features are avoidable \pause
* What Is Programming?
** Following Directions
*** Directions to Central Library 				    :B_block:

*** 								    :B_block:

    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    As a person you know how to translate directions into actions, maps into navigation
** Understanding Recipes

Cook celery and onion together til soft, then add frozen spinach and cook to get some of the moisture out and reduce volume add broth lentils cilantro and other spices, stir thoroughly, throw bay leaves on top.

Cook for 40 minutes

Turn off heat, wait til it stops bubbling and blend thoroughly.

Cook for 5-10 minutes after blending   
** Building Furniture

    Let's say you're building furniture from Scandanavian Store. You follow their wordless visual instructions to fit everything together step-by-step.
** Computation
   + Everything we can do is computation \pause
     + Finite data \pause
     + Finite steps \pause
     + Finite time
** Computers
   + Machines for performing computation \pause
   + Computers have limits \pause
     + Finite memory \pause
     + Finite programs \pause
     + Finite time
** Programs Are...
   + Precise instructions for computers \pause
   + Describe computations \pause
   + Readable for humans
** A Programming Language Is
   + A specialized language for instructions \pause
   + 
** Machines, Hand Holding, and New Ways of Thinking
   + Humans can infer instructions \pause
   + Machines cannot \pause
   + Precise thinking is hard \pause
   + And that's okay!
** Programming Languages
   + Programming language as /formal/ language of instructions \pause
   + Many different languages \pause
   + 

* Preliminaries
** Syntax
   + Human language is fluid \pause
   + Exhibit A: Tumblr \pause
   + Computers need unambiguous language \pause
   + Formal syntax
** Verbs vs. Nouns
   + Every language has nouns and verbs \pause
   + Nouns :: subject matter \pause
   + Verbs :: how it's used \pause
   + Nouns and verbs of Javascript \pause
     + Data \pause
     + Control flow
** Forms of Data
   + Strings \pause
   + Numbers \pause
   + Lists \pause
   + Collections
** Evaluating Code By Hand
   + All code can be evaluated by hand \pause
   + Useful skill \pause
   + Helps debugging

** Writing to Console
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
   + ~console.log~ 
   + takes a value and prints it
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  console.log("this message will print to the console");
#+END_SRC
** Expressions vs. Statements
* Basics of Javascript
** Arithmetic
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
   + basic arithmetic operations
   + addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
   + ~+~ , ~-~, ~*~, ~/~
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code :results output
  console.log(10 + 10);
  console.log(10 * 10);
  console.log(10 / 10);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 20
: 100
: 1

** Variables
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    + Variables store data
    + Names to keep track of things for later
    + "So my friend, let's call her 'Sue'..."
*** 							      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  var thisThing = "a variable!"
  console.log(thisThing);
#+END_SRC
** Variables As Containers
   + Variables are like boxes
   + What's in the box can change
   + 
** Choices 
*** 								    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    Choices appear in our informal experience with computation.

   + *if* the water is boiling, add the pasta \pause
   + *if* you owe taxes, send money to the IRS \pause
   + *if* it's friday, go grab tea with friends \pause
** Booleans
   + Need a way to make decisions \pause
   + ~true~ \pause
   + ~false~ \pause
   + Boolean type
** Equality
   + ~===~ compares two things \pause
** If-Statements
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  if (condition){
      ...
  // do these things if the condition is true
  }
  else {
      ...
  // do these things if the condition is false
  }
#+END_SRC
** If-statement examples
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  if (10 < 20) {
  console.log("one thing");
  }
  else {
  console.log("another thing"):
  }
#+END_SRC
** If-statement examples
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  if (10 < 30) {
      console.log("we'll do this thing");
  }
  console.log("afterwards we do these things");
#+END_SRC
** If-statement examples
*** Nesting if's					      :B_block:BMCOL:

Many times there's more than two choices. How do we represent that in JavaScript?

    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  if (...) {
      ...
  }
  else if (...) {
      ...
  }
  else if (...) {
      ...
  }
#+END_SRC
** If-statement examples
   if 
** Repetition

   + Do something a number of times \pause
   + Chop three onions \pause

   + Take three lefts since you can't turn right

** For Loops
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
for(setup; condition; next step){
   ...
}

** For Loop Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports code
  for(var v = 0; v < 10; v = v + 1){
     console.log(v);
  }
#+END_SRC
** While Loops
