* Why Learn Programming?
** What You'll Learn Here
   + What programming *is* \pause
   + The basics of Javascript \pause
   + What to learn next
** This Course
   + Three weeks \pause
   + Two hours each \pause
   + Lecture and small exercises \pause
     + Piggybacking on Code Academy
** Why Programming?
   + Jobs \pause
   + Automation \pause
   + Fun

* What Is Programming?
** Programming Is...
   + a way to instruct a computer \pause
   + to do /what/? \pause
   + are their limits?
** Computers as people
   + Computer as a job title \pause
   + Computers calculated as a series of steps \pause
   + Mostly number crunching \pause
   + Computation 
** Computation
   Computation is anything that uses \pause
     + Finite instructions \pause
     + Finite time \pause
     + Finite resources
** More Than Number Crunching
   + Computation > arithmetic \pause
   + 3D printers \pause
   + Robots \pause
   + Computation is physical
** Other Examples of Computation
*** Spinach Celery Soup						    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
Cook celery and onion together til soft, then add frozen spinach and cook to get some of the moisture out and reduce volume add broth lentils cilantro and other spices, stir thoroughly, throw bay leaves on top.

Cook for 40 minutes

Turn off heat, wait til it stops bubbling and blend thoroughly.

Cook for 5-10 minutes after blending
** Other Examples of Computations
   Many more examples exist in the wild including: \pause
   + counting on your fingers \pause
   + long division \pause
   + sorting your vinyl collection
** Limits of Computation
   + Are there things not programmable? \pause
   + Yes! \pause
     + But not much you care about \pause
   + Programs that analyze programs
** Limits of Computation
   + Physical limits \pause
   + No better computer can save you \pause
     + Not even quantum computers
** What are Programs?
*** 								    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
Programs are \pause descriptions of computations \pause in a special language \pause that's understandable to a computer
** Programming Languages
   + Human languages are too complicated \pause
   + "y'all'd've" \pause
   + Ever had trouble with directions?
** Programming Languages
   + Simpler than human ones \pause
   + Inflexible \pause
   + Precise \pause
   + Harder to think in
** Why JavaScript?
   + JavaScript runs in the browser
** JavaScript Console
** Syntax vs. Semantics
** Arithmetic
** Arithmetic Examples
