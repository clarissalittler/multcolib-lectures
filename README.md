Lecture notes for upcoming mini courses at library

The basic format is going to be three lectures of two hours each, covering the very basics of programming and a roadmap for study. 

You can't give a full intro in that short of a time, not even remotely, so let's instead figure out what the truly useful thing to do would be.

My basic thoughts are that we should mostly try to convey

+ that programming is doable
+ what programming really is and how it relates to kinds of thinking we already know
+ an actual trajectory for what to learn and how it relates to job placement and other goals
